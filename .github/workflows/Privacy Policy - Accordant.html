<h5>Accordant Media provides marketers with a complete solution for identifying and targeting prospects. We were founded on the principle of transparency, which is why this section of our website is very important.</h5>
<h4>Accordant Media advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.</h4>
<p>Companies that deliver more relevant advertisements play an important role in keeping the Internet free for consumers. Consumers have a better experience if the communications they receive are relevant to their interests.</p>
<p>Advertisers will pay more when their ads are tailored to an audience’s interests, and publishers of websites and apps get more money when their audiences receive tailored advertisements instead of generic ones. This is how publishers continue to provide great content for free or very reasonable rates. Technology can help all of these interests align.</p>
<p>The policies below will tell you more about our policies for AccordantMedia.com, the website, as well as Accordant Media Advertising Technology, which is used by our marketer clients.</p>
<h2 id="advertising-privacy-policy" class="anchor">Advertising Service Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to information collected by Accordant Media (“Company”, “we” or “us”), via our targeted advertising technology service across third-party partner websites and mobile devices. Our service provides advertisers, their agencies, website and applications publishers, data vendors and other partners access to technologies designed to display relevant advertisements to consumers viewing a publisher’s online properties and applications. This document will outline our privacy practices, including how we collect and utilize information obtained, as they pertain to our advertising technology service. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your information and how you can opt-out of having your information collected. For more information on opting out of our services, click <a href="#opt-out2">here</a>. For our separate privacy policy covering information collection through our corporate website, click <a href="#site-privacy-policy">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our services are designed to be in compliance with the DAA, DAAC, and EDAA Self-Regulatory Code in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Click <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you would like further information regarding the DAA principles. Click <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you would like further information regarding the DAAC principles. Click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you would like further information on the EDAA principles.</p>
<div><a title="TRUSTe Privacy Certification" href="//privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=a9af5d3a-a0c5-4318-be6b-96db224d81e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="border: none;" src="//privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/seal?rid=a9af5d3a-a0c5-4318-be6b-96db224d81e5" alt="TRUSTe Privacy Certification" /></a></div>
<h5>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h5>
<p>Our service collects information about the website(s) and/or applications that a browser and/or mobile browsing device visits and the advertisements that a browser displays while online. You may encounter our technology when we, or one of our advertising partners, purchases online advertisements on a website that you visit, an application that you use, and/or other online or digital properties. We review the information collected by our service in order to help make the advertising you see more relevant to you.</p>
<p>In the course of providing our service, we do not collect information generally considered personally identifiable information in the United States (“PII”) such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card information, financial account numbers, or health related information. If we discover that information generally considered PII has been inadvertently collected by our technology, we will take reasonable steps to remove the PII .</p>
<p>In the course of providing our service, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), such as your IP type, IP address, ISP address, cookie IDs and segment IDs associated with cookie IDs, pages viewed and/or search terms entered on partner websites, browser type, operating system, duration and frequency of visits to partner websites, the date and time that advertising was viewed, clickstream data and other log file data. To provide relevant advertising for mobile users, we may also collect device type, make and model, operating system, carrier user ID, IDFA and similar device IDs, and information about the apps you use. We may also use the location of your device if you have decided to provide it to one of our partners. Non-PII may be used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than our service, including both offline and online sources, and as otherwise described below under “Information Usage.”</p>
<h5>INFORMATION USAGE</h5>
<p>We use the Non-PII we collect through our Service for a variety of purposes, including to help us deliver targeted advertising to consumers, to analyze interactions with and performance of our Service, measure the effectiveness of advertising on behalf of our advertising partners, and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement. A more detailed explanation of how we may use such information to provide “Interest-Based Advertising” is provided in the paragraph below. We may also use Non-PII data from third parties (such as data vendors) pursuant to their own privacy policies, and provide access to or share Non-PII with any number of third parties, including but not limited to business partners, affiliates and advertising clients. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our technology with Non-PII collected from our business partners.</p>
<h5>INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</h5>
<p>We may ourselves, or with third party vendors, use Non-PII in connection with our own or vendor information to deliver targeted advertising to you across websites and mobile applications. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described below may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites or mobile applications you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any PII. As a result, we and our vendor know your interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under <a href="#opt-out2">&#8220;Opt-Out&#8221;</a>.</p>
<h5>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h5>
<p>“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for these purposes. We and our business partners and advertisers may use cookies (or clear gifs, web beacons or similar devices, including devices that function in the mobile environment as well as locally stored objects such as HTML5 web storage) to collect information and other behavioral data from users for purposes such as targeting advertising services and better understanding the effectiveness of our advertisements. We use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains active on your hard drive for up to one (1) year. We set a persistent cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of users to enhance the services we provide. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Note that this may cause some sites to work incorrectly. For further instructions on restricting the placement of cookies or opting-out of this type of targeted advertising, please see <a href="#opt-out2">&#8220;Opt-Out&#8221;</a>,&#8221; below.</p>
<h5 id="cross-device-matching2" class="anchor">CROSS DEVICE MATCHING</h5>
<p>We or our third party vendors analyze device activity data using a mathematical tool known as a “probabilistic algorithm” to determine if you have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices. In connection with this analysis, we may rely on Non-PII (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors, pursuant to their own privacy policies or we may use the Non-PII we collect in conjunction with such third party data. Our advertisers may also provide us with deterministic data about you that may be used to supplement our probabilistic data. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated and may provide other services to our advertisers such as tools, analyses, data and insights to see how their website or mobile applications are used and to further enable cross-device targeting and analysis. For further instructions on restricting our use of certain cross-device data, please see <a href="#opt-out2">&#8220;Opt-Out&#8221;</a>,&#8221; below.</p>
<h5 id="clickstream2" class="anchor">CLICKSTREAM</h5>
<p>As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a web site’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to another web site. We may collect and use clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout websites and how we may tailor our advertising to better meet consumer needs. This information will be used to improve our Service. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous, and will not intentionally contain any PII.</p>
<h5>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h5>
<p>Advertisements we place may contain links to other web sites, including our advertisers’ web sites. Some of our advertisers or third-party web site or technology partners may place their own cookies and/or other data collection tools on your Internet browser outside of our Service; however, we have no access to or control over these cookies and/or other data collection tools. These other domains and/or web sites are not controlled by the Company. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every web site that they interact with. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites. Visiting these other web sites is at your own risk.</p>
<h5 id="security-retention2" class="anchor">SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</h5>
<p>We have undertaken and will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to user data retained in our servers, however, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information provided online. We retain the Non-PII information collected via our technology for up to three (3) years. After that time, we aggregate the data and retain it for analytical purposes. Please note that Company will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>
<h5 id="children2" class="anchor">INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN</h5>
<p>Our services are designed for those 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any information in violation of our policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.</p>
<h5 id="modifications2" class="anchor">POLICY MODIFICATIONS</h5>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use any data in a way that materially differs from this policy, we will post such changes here. We encourage you to periodically review this website for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
<h5 id="opt-out2" class="anchor">OPT-OUT</h5>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer (or mobile device) or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.</p>
<p>In addition, you may restrict the placement of cookies or opt out of Interest-Based Advertising (whether targeted through cookies, beacons, or other tracking technologies) that is served through a web browser (including a mobile web browser) by setting a cookie which tells our systems to ignore you and not display targeted ads. To opt out of such advertising, click <a href="http://prmgr.a3cloud.net/optout.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self- regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info</a>, at <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youradchoices.ca</a>, and at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, the opt-out must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.</strong> For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. However, once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”) we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes and we will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.</p>
<p>Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. If you choose to opt out using our opt-out tool, we will add a cookie to your browser identifying it as an opted-out browser. Once you have elected to opt-out and our system has refreshed (which may take up to twenty-four hours), our advertising system will not collect or use any behavioral data associated with your browser for targeted advertising services for so long as our opt-out cookie remains in place.</p>
<h5 id="mobile-opt-out2" class="anchor">MOBILE APPLICATION &#8212; USER OPT-OUT</h5>
<p><strong>We remind you that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications.</strong> However, you may download and use the DAA’s AppChoices mobile app on your iOS or Android device in order to opt out of our interest-based advertising on mobile applications. Links to this application are below:</p>

<h5 id="information-collection" class="anchor">INFORMATION COLLECTION</h5>
<p>We may collect Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or credit card information (“PII”) from the Site only when you choose to provide it to us. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online contact request form on the Site. We use this information to contact you to respond to your inquiry and as otherwise permitted by this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We use the Non-PII we collect through our Site for a variety of purposes, including to help us deliver targeted advertising to consumers, to analyze interactions with and performance of our Site, measure the effectiveness of advertising on behalf of our advertising partners, and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement.

In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this privacy policy. Finally, please note that if you specifically consent to additional uses of your PII, we may use your PII in a manner consistent with that consent.</p>
<h5 id="interest-advertising" class="anchor">INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</h5>

Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout websites and how we may tailor our advertising to better meet consumer needs. This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous, and will not intentionally contain any PII.</p>

<h5 id="modifications" class="anchor">POLICY MODIFICATIONS</h5>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use any data in a way that materially differs from this policy, we will post such changes here. We encourage you to periodically review the Site for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
<h5 id="opt-out" class="anchor">OPT-OUT</h5>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p>
<p>In addition, you may restrict the placement of cookies or opt out of Interest-Based Advertising that is served through a web browser by setting a cookie which tells our systems to ignore you and not display targeted ads. To opt out of such advertising, click <a href="http://prmgr.a3cloud.net/optout.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. If you choose to opt out using our opt-out tool, we will add a cookie to your browser identifying it as an opted-out browser. Once you have elected to opt-out and our system has refreshed (which may take up to twenty-four hours), our advertising system will not collect or use any behavioral data associated with your browser for targeted advertising services for so long as our opt-out cookie remains in place.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.aboutads.info</a>, at <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youradchoices.ca</a>, and at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
<p><b>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.</b> For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. However, once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”) we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes and we will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.</p>
<p>If you receive an email from us, you may unsubscribe from future unsolicited emails through a link, typically at the bottom of the e-mail. If you have consented to have your PII shared with any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes and you no longer wish to have your PII shared with such parties, then you may opt-out of such disclosures by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@accordantmedia.com">privacy@accordantmedia.com</a>. However, we are not responsible for removing your PII from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this privacy policy or your separate consent.</p>
